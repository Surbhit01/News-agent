The report added that 72% of the undertrials had not completed school and 51% of them had no documents needed to pursue the trial and proceedings. As per the report, 52% of the undertrials were under 30 years of age and 58% suffered from at least one disability.

      "‘Disturbing findings’\n",
      "\n",
      "Describing the key findings of the report as disturbing, Supreme Court Justice Vikram Nath on Friday (November 7, 2025) called for urgent reforms in the way legal aid is provided to undertrials. He added that over 70% of India’s prison population consists of people who have not yet been found guilty but they remain in jails.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what is more concerning is that, in most cases, they don’t even know that they have a right to [free] legal aid. Of the 74% undertrials, only 7.91% have utilised the legal aid available to them. Even in cases where they do know, they often refrain from seeking it due to distrust stemming from past experiences,” said Justice Nath at the release of a report on fair trials prepared by the Square Circle Clinic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Nath said that most of the undertrials prefer to engage some private advocate believing that if they pay someone, he will do better than the person who is getting nothing out of it. He criticised the way lawyers file bail applications mechanically, without supporting documents or sureties that the accused can actually produce.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The accused cannot afford the bail amount, cannot find sureties, and he is back to square one. He just waits, not because the law makes him, but because the system has failed him,” he said, adding that he comes across one such case almost every day where an undertrial has spent time in prison exceeding the maximum sentence for the very offence he or she is accused of.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are undertrials charged with bailable offences who remain in custody simply because they could not furnish bail. There are undertrials who would have been acquitted or given suspended sentences had their trials concluded promptly - yet they continue to languish,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He added that the FTP report calls for a change in how law is taught in colleges. Every law school must treat legal aid clinics as places where justice comes alive, not as extra work to be checked off a list, Justice Nath said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If a young lawyer’s first real experience of law comes from meeting an undertrial - from seeing his fear and hope- rather than from reading it in a book, we will have already begun to reshape our profession,” he added.\n",

      "The Square Circle Clinic, a Fair Trial Programme (FTP) of NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad, has highlighted critical issues faced by undertrial inmates in India through a report covering 5,783 cases from 2019-2024. The report reveals that 41.3% of accused undertrials had no lawyer, 77% had no family contact, 72% had not completed school, and 51% lacked necessary documents for trial. Demographically, 52% were under 30, 58% had at least one disability, 67.6% belonged to disadvantaged castes, and 79.8% worked in the unorganised sector. The clinic's efforts led to 1,834 bail applications, 777 case disposals, and the release of 1,388 clients in 2,542 cases, exemplified by Vanita Devi, who was bailed in 2022 after over five years in jail for a crime she denies, now diagnosed with mental illness and helping at a clinic. Supreme Court Justice Vikram Nath described the report's findings as 'disturbing,' noting that over 70% of India's prison population are undertrials, many unaware of their right to free legal aid (only 7.91% utilize it) or distrustful of it. He criticized the mechanical filing of bail applications that fail to consider an accused's ability to afford bail or find sureties, leading to prolonged incarceration even for bailable offenses or beyond the maximum sentence. Justice Nath called for urgent reforms in legal aid and stressed the need for law schools to integrate legal aid clinics as core components of legal education.\n"

      "SUMMARY: Vanita Devi, an undertrial accused of killing her children, spent over five years in jail before securing bail in 2022 through the Square Circle Clinic, a Fair Trial Programme (FTP) of NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad. Her case exemplifies the challenges faced by many undertrials, as she was abandoned by family and later diagnosed with mental illness. The Square Circle Clinic, which has handled over 5,000 cases since 2019, released a report detailing disturbing findings: 41.3% of accused had no lawyer, 77% lost family contact, 72% had not completed school, 51% lacked necessary documents, 52% were under 30, and 58% had a disability. Additionally, 67.6% belonged to disadvantaged castes and 79.8% worked in the unorganised sector. In five years, the clinic filed 1,834 bail applications and secured the release of 1,388 clients in 2,542 cases. Supreme Court Justice Vikram Nath, on November 7, 2025, highlighted the urgent need for legal aid reforms, noting that over 70% of India's prison population are undertrials, many unaware of their right to free legal aid or distrustful of the system. He criticised the mechanical filing of bail applications and the inability of undertrials to furnish bail, leading to prolonged detention, sometimes exceeding maximum sentences for their alleged offences. Justice Nath also called for a transformation in legal education, urging law schools to treat legal aid clinics as vital components for practical justice delivery.\n",

      "SUMMARY: Chief Justice of India-designate, Justice Surya Kant, stated on Saturday (November 8, 2025) at an Indian Women’s Press Corps event that the malicious trolling of women journalists, involving the misuse of private data and fabrication of incriminating content, cannot be normalized as an inevitable consequence of online discourse.

      "SUMMARY: On November 8, 2025, the Congress party criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating he would now certainly attend the G20 Summit in South Africa in person, following U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement that he would boycott the event. The Congress, through AICC general secretary Jairam Ramesh, alluded to their earlier claim that PM Modi had addressed the ASEAN Summit virtually last month to avoid meeting Mr. Trump. President Trump stated on November 7, 2025, that no American official would attend the G20 Summit in South Africa (scheduled for November 22-23, 2025), citing 'human rights abuses' against Afrikaners and questioning South Africa's inclusion in the G20. The article also briefly mentions Trump's disputed claims about resolving the India-Pakistan conflict and ongoing India-U.S. trade talks.\n",

Justices B.V. Nagarathna and B. Mahadevan observed that the absence of directions from Special/Sessions Courts for victim compensation forces victims to pursue it independently, contributing to the systemic delay and lack of awareness.\n",
