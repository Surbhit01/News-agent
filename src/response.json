      "title": "Vande Mataram row: Congress cites CWC statement of 1937, says PM 'insulted' Tagore",
      "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vande-mataram-row-congress-cites-cwc-statement-of-1937-says-pm-insulted-tagore/article70258857.ece",
      "summary": "The Congress party has escalated its criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the 'Vande Mataram' row, accusing him of insulting the 1937 Congress Working Committee (CWC) and Rabindranath Tagore. This follows PM Modi's statement on Friday that crucial stanzas of the national song were dropped in 1937, which he claimed sowed the seeds of partition and represented a 'divisive mindset.'\n\nCongress general secretary Jairam Ramesh stated that the CWC, which met in 1937 and included prominent leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, issued a statement on 'Vande Mataram' profoundly influenced by Rabindranath Tagore. The CWC recommended singing only the first two stanzas of the song, citing that they described the beauty of the motherland without religious objection, while subsequent stanzas contained religious allusions that might not be in keeping with other religious groups.\n\nCongress further presented excerpts from Tagore's biography and a letter to Nehru, where Tagore expressed his approval of the first two stanzas but not the latter ones due to their sentiments. Ramesh emphasized that the RSS played no role in the Freedom Movement, making Modi's criticism unsurprising. The party demanded an apology from PM Modi and urged him to focus on contemporary issues like economic inequality, unemployment, and foreign policy rather than historical debates."
