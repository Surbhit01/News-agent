    "summary": "Rahul Gandhi, Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, alleged on Sunday (November 9, 2025) that the Election Commission's Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls is an attempt to cover up and institutionalize \"vote theft.\" Speaking in Pachmarhi, Madhya Pradesh, where he was attending a Congress training camp, Gandhi claimed that 2.5 million votes (1 in 8) were stolen in Haryana, a point he previously presented. He further stated that similar \"vote theft\" occurred in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh, attributing it to a system involving the BJP and the EC. Gandhi asserted that this constitutes an attack on democracy and Ambedkar's Constitution by Prime Minister Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, and Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh. The Election Commission of India has previously stated that Gandhi's claims regarding the Haryana voter list are unfounded. Gandhi also mentioned that they possess more detailed information, which will be gradually revealed."

These massive search and cordon operations, conducted by joint teams of Police, Army, CRPF, and SOG units, target local terrorists operating from Pakistan and their associates. The operations include questioning suspected individuals, searching premises of relatives and known associates of active terrorists and OGWs, and tightening security in vulnerable areas.

    "summary": "Vanita Devi, an undertrial accused of killing her children, spent over five years in jail before being granted bail in 2022 due to the intervention of the Square Circle Clinic, a Fair Trial Programme (FTP) of NALSAR University of Law. Diagnosed with mental illness, she now assists patients at the clinic that sheltered her. Her case exemplifies the challenges faced by many undertrials in India. The Square Circle Clinic, formerly Project 39A-NLU Delhi, has handled over 5,000 cases since its inception in 2019, primarily at Nagpur and Yerawada Central Prisons. Its report (2019-2024) revealed disturbing statistics: 41.3% of accused had no lawyer, 77% lost family contact, 72% had not completed school, 51% lacked necessary documents, 52% were under 30, 58% had a disability, 67.6% were from disadvantaged castes, and 79.8% worked in the unorganised sector. The clinic filed bail applications in 1,834 cases, disposed of 777, and secured the release of 1,388 clients. Supreme Court Justice Vikram Nath, on November 7, 2025, called for urgent reforms, noting that over 70% of India's prison population are undertrials, with only 7.91% utilizing available legal aid due to unawareness or distrust. He criticized the mechanical filing of bail applications and highlighted cases where undertrials remain incarcerated despite being charged with bailable offenses or having spent time exceeding the maximum sentence for their alleged crime. Justice Nath also advocated for a change in legal education, urging law schools to treat legal aid clinics as crucial learning environments for budding lawyers."

    "summary": "RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, on November 9, 2025, addressed criticisms from Congress leaders, including Mallikarjun Kharge and Priyank Kharge, regarding the RSS's lack of formal registration and its stance on the Indian tri-colour. Bhagwat stated that the RSS, established in 1925, was not expected to register with the British government, and post-independence, the Indian government did not mandate registration for organizations like theirs. He explained that the RSS is recognized as a 'body of individuals' by the Income Tax department and courts, which has led to income tax exemption. Bhagwat also highlighted that the organization's three bans by the government signify its recognition. Regarding the national flag, he clarified that while the saffron flag is treated as a Guru within the RSS, they hold high respect for, offer tribute to, and protect the Indian tri-colour."
